CategorySetPluginOutlook2013
============================

One useful feature of Outlook (starting with Outlook 2007 I beleive) is mail "categories". Mere mortals (like Google programmers) would call them "tags" but Microsoft has its own way of naming things. Anyways, this often overlooked feature gives a nice productivity boost for those who get a lot of e-mail and have to return to saved messages often. "Traditional" way of organizing saved e-mail, i.e. saving messages into different folders is prevalent today, but it has its drawbacks. E.g., if an e-mail belongs to several topics, folders do not help much. Categories (or tags, same thing) solve this problem by allowing to tag each e-mail with however many topics/tags user likes. With tags, messages can be all saved into one folder and then retrieved using 'Search Folders' feature very neatly.

All of this IMHO would work very well and would be adopted widely if MS created a more usable interface for it in Outlook and advertized the feature more. As of today, however, the stock "Categorize" button in Outlook has a limit of showing only 15 MRU categories, making the button practically useless in the case a user has more than 15 active tags (I use ~30 routinely, and the list is growing).

This Outlook Add-In here is an attempt to replace the stock "Categorize" button with a useful one. It is similar in functionality to original control, but displays all available tags at once. I use it on day-to-day basis and it really saves time when tagging lots of incoming e-mail.

Currently, the new button doesn't replace the stock one, but appears to the right of the default ribbon. If I figure out how to replace stock one while preserving 'All Categories dialog' entry - I'll do that.

Happy Outlooking

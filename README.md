CategorySetPluginOutlook2013
============================

This Add-In for MS Outlook 2013 replaces the stock "Categorize" button with one not limited to 15 most recently used categories:

It is similar in functionality to the original control, but instead of showing 15 most recently used categories, it displays all available categories. Written for and tested on MS Outlook 2013.

The Add-In can be downloaded [here](../../releases/latest).

Happy Outlooking

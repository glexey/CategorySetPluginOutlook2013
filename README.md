CategorySetPluginOutlook2013
============================

This Outlook Add-In replaces the stock "Categorize" button with one not limited to 15 most recently used categories:

It is similar in functionality to original control, but instead of displaying 15 most recently used ones, it displays all available tags at once.

You can download the Add-In [here](../../releases).

Happy Outlooking
